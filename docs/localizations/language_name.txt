Instead of translating this text, please provide the name of your language as you want it to be displayed in AnkiDroid settings. For example if you translate to French, it would be "Français". If you translate to Brazilian Portuguese, it is "Português (Brasil)". This string will be displayed as an element of a list, so it probably should start by an upper case when this concept makes sense.
